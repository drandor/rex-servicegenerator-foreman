=head2 Rex::Ext::ServiceGenerator::Foreman - Auto Service Generator

This is a small extension to create rex services on the fly from foreman/puppet enc files.

=head2 Howto use

Just clone the repository and install rex.

The test enc file is in I<enc> directory. In I<lib> directory are 2 required Rex modules.

The I<module> directory contains 3 example modules (which are doing nothing at the moment). And the I<service> folder contains one example service.

 cd service/frontend
 rex -T
 rex -H gearman01 setup

To use this you need the following Perl modules: I<YAML::Perl>, I<IO::All>.
